### About me
I am currently a student at Saskatchewan Polytechnic in Regina, where I'm pursuing my passion for technology and software development. Before enrolling in this program, I worked in various fields and explored different career paths. However, throughout those experiences, one thing remained constant: my deep fascination with computers and how they work.

### Project Information
This repository contains my website with all my web-related projects — including school assignments and personal work I do in my free time. </br>
I'll try to update it as much as possible :)
