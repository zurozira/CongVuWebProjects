### My Web Projects

About me
---------
I am currently a student at Saskpoly in Regina. I work in different fields before but I always know that I love computer, so I made a decision to change to Programming.

Project Information
---------
This repository contains my website with all my web-related projects — including school assignments and personal work I do in my free time.
I'll try to update it as much as possible :) Soon I'll implement dotNet and C# in my web as well - Coming soon
